#### Description: 
This Weight Loss Calculator is an Android Application developed with Andoid Studio (Language:Kotlin). This Weight Loss App helps you to check your BMR. BMR (Basal metabolic rate) is the amount of energy needed for your body’s physiological functions at rest, such as your breathing, your heart beating, and your brain activity. Since most people don’t have the ability to have indirect calorimetry performed, formulas have been created to calculate BMR using weight, height, age, and gender. If you know what your Basal Metabolic Rate is, you can estimate the minimal amount of calories you need to take in to live, which helps you to evaluate the total number of calories you should provide to your body daily. You may use this information for the basis for your weight loss plan. Before developing this app, I made sure all my packages were up to date and that I installed the latest Android Studio, and all of this was done on an Ubuntu based Linux Operating system. Working with Kotlin is something that is new to me but thanks to having some experience with Java where alot of the same functions or similar functions still work in Kotlin when writing code for the View objects in the binding I made on the MainActivity, I was able to write code efficently and have a feeling of familiarity. Because the BMR fomular is based upon a lot of factors; height, weight, age, and gender, I needed to use a conditional when I received input from the radio button, indicating the user's gender and then process through my calculateBMR function the appropriate data. The Mifflin-St Jeor formula that I used to calculate with requires kilograms, and centimeters but because my audience uses feet and pounds I also made conversions to the formula's unit system so I can calculate the BMR. Below is the equation:

Men: BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) + 5

Women: BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) - 161

The UI is built in XML and contains styling, to shape the user experience. One of the things that make this app user-friendly is the addition of default values that I assigned to the numberPicker components, so the user can quickly scroll to a weight without having to start from a number like zero, I also wanted to invalidate bad data such as a negative age, or a weight/height that was unrealistic so I bounded my numberPicker fields with min and max values so I wouldn't have to deal with processing bad data from the user. I set results to a blank text field which I got by ID and passed the BMR result to a stringFormat function that I set to the appropriate TextView.

The app is built to be responsive, unlike a form that after filling out all fields requires you to click a button to then process and calculate what you are trying to find. Instead this app will use on value change functions on all user input fields to call the calculateBMR function and live process things as values change. Additionally this allows the user to scroll through their weight/height/age on the number field and see how an increase or decrease in one of the fields will affect their BMR, taking away the inconvienence of having to click a button to call the function after all required fields are filled out. The app also makes use of the latest android libraries because it was built with the most recent version of Android Studio at the time of writing which is Dolphin, and uses Material themed text-appearance, and will adapt to your phones set light or dark theme. The icons are also an upgrade from older versions of Android studio because they are based on XML instead of a mix of different resolution png files in the res/ folder.

A .gitignore file is added to this project to help keep out build files and other user-related development files that aren't meant to be in this source repository to make collaboration more effective if anyone wishes to contribute or fork this repository to make something completely new from what has been built.
