#### Description: This Weight Loss Calculator is an Android Application developed with Andoid Studio (Language:Kotlin). This Weight Loss App helps you to check your BMR. BMR (Basal metabolic rate) is the amount of energy needed for your body’s physiological functions at rest, such as your breathing, your heart beating, and your brain activity. Since most people don’t have the ability to have indirect calorimetry performed, formulas have been created to calculate BMR using weight, height, age, and gender. If you know what your Basal Metabolic Rate is, you can estimate the minimal amount of calories you need to take in to live, which helps you to evaluate the total number of calories you should provide to your body daily. You may use this information for the basis for your weight loss plan.
